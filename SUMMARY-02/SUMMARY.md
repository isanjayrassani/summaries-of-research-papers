### 2. Introduction:
In this Research Paper authors or researchers reproduced two old studies with the motive of providing additionally the observed evidence on the influencing effects of linearity of source code and programmers’ comprehension strategy on linearity of reading order.
Several factors are needed to understand the source code by programmers, including the source code itself and the programmer. 
In recent studies they shown that new programmers read the source code more like a natural language text otherwise experts follow the program execution flow. But, it is unknown how the linearity of source code and the comprehension strategy influence programmers’ linearity of reading order.

### 3. Research Methodology:
To comprehend the effects of linearity of source code on reading order, they conducted a non-exact reproduction of studies by Busjahn et al. and Peachock et al., which compared the reading order of new and expert programmers. 
Like the original studies, they used an eye-tracker to record the eye movements of participants,
Their results revealed that studies on the reading behavior of programmers must carefully select source code snippets to control the influence of confounding factors.
Further they identified a need for further studies on how programmers should structure source code to align it with their natural reading behavior in order to ease program understandings.

### 4. Result:
They found that experience regulates reading behavior.
Also, source code’s linearity has even stronger effect on reading behavior instead of experience, the comprehension strategy has minor effect, in comparison with the fact.
